This MCP server connects to Exa's hosted MCP server via HTTP transport.

The API key is optional - the server works without an API key via Smithery (with rate limits).

For full access without rate limits:
1. Sign up for an [Exa API account](https://dashboard.exa.ai)
2. Generate your API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)
3. Add the API key to your Zed settings
