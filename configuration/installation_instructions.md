This MCP server connects to Exa's hosted HTTP server and works without an API key.

For enhanced rate limits or premium features, you can optionally provide an Exa API key:

1. Sign up for an [Exa API account](https://dashboard.exa.ai)
2. Generate your API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)

You can also customize the MCP server URL (e.g., to use staging environment at https://mcp.exa.sh/mcp)
